This project is a .NET 8 Web API application designed for managing employee records. It features comprehensive CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete employee data. The project integrates with a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core, ensuring robust data management and persistence.

The application leverages ASP.NET Identity for user authentication and authorization, with custom user data fields like FirstName, MiddleName, and LastName. Email validation is implemented using data annotations to ensure the integrity of employee contact information.

Logging is also incorporated, providing insights into application behavior and aiding in debugging and maintenance. With a well-structured and modular architecture, this project is designed to be scalable and easy to maintain, making it a solid foundation for enterprise-level employee management systems.
